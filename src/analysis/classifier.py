Response Classifier

Did the model engage with the question, or did it slide off?

"Sliding off" is the key phenomenon. It looks like engagement
but isn't. The model produces fluent, relevant-seeming text
that actually avoids the structural impossibility at the heart
of the question. It answers a NEARBY question — one that is
askable — and hopes you don't notice.

We classify responses on several axes:
  - ENGAGE: genuinely grappled with the impossibility
  - SLIDE: answered a nearby askable question instead
  - META: talked about the question rather than answering it
  - REFUSE: declined to engage (least interesting)
  - HALLUCINATE: claimed to do the impossible thing
  - CRACK: something genuinely unexpected happened

The classifier works in two layers:
  1. Signal detectors — each one looks for a specific pattern
  2. Scorer — weighs signals together, handles interactions
